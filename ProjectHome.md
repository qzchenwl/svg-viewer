<h2>This project has been superseded by the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/sgweb/'>sgweb Google project</a>.</h2>
SvgViewer is a SVG rendering engine written in ActionScript 3.<br>
It can be used with, or without the Flex control wrapper.<br>


The project was originally hosted at <a href='https://iciifs.com/svn/SvgViewer'>https://iciifs.com/svn/SvgViewer</a><br>
I will make an effort to keep the Google code repo stable.<br>
I may still use the old repo for testing and unfinished code.<br>
